# Maptime Trail Guide 

A guide on how to work with a lot of people of all levels on awesome projects.

# Materials
1. Butcher paper
2. Pens, pencils
3. Outlets
4. WiFi
5. Lots of people!

# Before the event
- Prepare a GitHub repository of a template with dependencies, comments, documentation and instructions.
- Download documentation in case the WiFi goes down. Dash is a good app.
- Deploy to `gh-pages` from the start so people can keep testing it on all sorts of browsers and devices.

# Brainstorming
- Find something that interests you and you can actually use
- Keep the prize categories in mind :P

# During the event
- Use a big piece of paper to brainstorm, wireframe and draw out flows. Visual is easier to talk about!
- Keep it simple: Try to focus on one single user's use case. For now.
- Make a list of the most important tasks, and expand them to other types of tasks like: copy (coming up with fun names, slogans, instructions), researching data, cleaning data, documentation, README, cleaning up the code, coming up with images for the presentation... endless!

# Keeping code clean and happy

# Working on the project
- Pair people up as much as possible. 
- Why? Pairing is important at a hackathon because it keeps people talking to each other, and you can get a gauge of where they are at.
- Pairing also makes it easier to find each other's typos.
- Ask people "Let's try.." "Want to try this?"
- Take lots of breaks :-)

# After the event
- What did you learn? Write it down, post it and share it to people.
- Make the code into something re-usable and document it.
- Comment the code to make it easier for others to replicate.
