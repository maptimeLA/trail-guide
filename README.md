# Maptime Hackathon Trail Guide 

A guide on how to work with a lot of people of all levels on awesome projects.

# Materials
1. Butcher paper
2. Pens, pencils
3. Outlets
4. WiFi
5. Lots of people!

# Before the event
- Prepare a GitHub repository of a template with dependencies, comments, documentation and instructions.
- Download documentation in case the WiFi goes down. Dash is a good app.
- Deploy to `gh-pages` from the start so people can keep testing it on all sorts of browsers and devices.

# Brainstorming
- Find something that interests you and you can actually use
- Keep the prize categories in mind :P

# During the event
- Use a big piece of paper to brainstorm, wireframe and draw out flows. Visual is easier to talk about!
- Keep it simple: Try to focus on one single user's use case. For now.
- Make a list of the most important tasks, and expand them to other types of tasks like: copy (coming up with fun names, slogans, instructions), researching data, cleaning data, documentation, README, cleaning up the code, coming up with images for the presentation... endless!

# Keeping code clean and happy

# Working on the project
- Pair people up as much as possible. 
- Why? Pairing is important at a hackathon because it keeps people talking to each other, and you can get a gauge of where they are at.
- Pairing also makes it easier to find each other's typos.
- Ask people "Let's try.." "Want to try this?"
- Take lots of breaks :-)

# After the event
- What did you learn? Write it down, post it and share it to people.
- Make the code into something re-usable and document it.
- Comment the code to make it easier for others to replicate.

# Want to contribute?
- Make a pull request!

# Maptime Project Guide
# Project guide
0. **Google Form**: Is the data open-source? Will the resulting project be deployed up on GitHub for Maptime? Will the project go somewhere else? Will the Project Organizers/Lead/(Client?) join the GitHub project to make sure all tasks and requests are kept in public/open? No project scope-creep abuse.
1. **GitHub Repository**: Keep README.md updated with Humans.txt and Data Source
2. **Google Drive folder**: Data cleaning, gathering, editing
3. **Slack channel**: Connect GitHub and Google Drive updates to Slack. Add GitHub and Google Drive folder links to Slack topic.
4. Let people see the data on a map as soon as possible: Try to get .geojson up as soon as you can. Post that map up.
5. Start **brainstorming** and **wireframing**: Is the project a static data project or dynamic data? Will it be interactive? Draw and post wireframes. Think about all sorts of features and assignments: **Mapping**, **Data quality-checking**, **Writing copy that explains the map**, **Making logos**, **Designing the map**, **Designing the page**, **Finding more data to add**, **Data analyzing**, **Animating**â€¦
6. **Minimum viable map**: After initial wireframes, define a `minimum viable map`, and prioritize the tasks towards reaching that goal. Assign pairs of people to these tasks as issues on GitHub.
7. **Deploy**.
8. **Test**. Make issues for bugs. Assign bugs to people. Fix them. Repeat Step 7.
9. Go back to the tasks from step 5 and keep tackling new features and tasks.
10. **Spread the map love**! Then write a blog post about how we made the map and what we learned from it. Write about how other people can make similar maps by forking this one and adding their own data layers.


# Meetup guide
1. Draft Meetup information on Google Drive + Slack
- Give people instructions on what to do before they get there. Usually installation (Linux/Mac/Windows) for people who bring laptops. No laptops is okay too.
- Write a story: Why should we attend the meetup? To learn what? Write for beginners. Write also for regular attendees.
- Set learning goals so people know what to expect.
2. Order food and drinks. Prep logistics for that - plates, napkins.
3. Prepare Meetup lesson materials. Post those all online in a GitHub repository so people can clone it before they get there.
4. Take notes and photos during the event. Upload them to Flickr and GitHub.
