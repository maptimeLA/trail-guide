# Maptime Project Guide
## Project guide
0. **Google Form**: Is the data open-source? Will the resulting project be deployed up on GitHub for Maptime? Will the project go somewhere else? Will the Project Organizers/Lead/(Client?) join the GitHub project to make sure all tasks and requests are kept in public/open? No project scope-creep abuse.
1. **GitHub Repository**: Start with the `mapstarter` repository. Keep README.md updated with Humans.txt and Data Source. Start with README.md already with deployment, cloning instructions. Deploy to `gh-pages` from the start so people can keep testing it on all sorts of browsers and devices.
2. **Google Drive folder**: Data cleaning, gathering, editing
3. **Slack channel**: Connect GitHub and Google Drive updates to Slack. Add GitHub and Google Drive folder links to Slack topic.
4. Let people see the data on a map as soon as possible: Try to get .geojson up as soon as you can. Post that map up.
5. Start **brainstorming** and **wireframing**: Is the project a static data project or dynamic data? Will it be interactive? Draw and post wireframes. Think about all sorts of features and assignments: **Mapping**, **Data quality-checking**, **Writing copy that explains the map**, **Making logos**, **Designing the map**, **Designing the page**, **Finding more data to add**, **Data analyzing**, **Animating**…
6. **Minimum viable map**: After initial wireframes, define a `minimum viable map`, and prioritize the tasks towards reaching that goal. Assign pairs of people to these tasks as issues on GitHub.
7. **Deploy**.
8. **Test**. Make issues for bugs. Assign bugs to people. Fix them. Repeat Step 7.
9. Go back to the tasks from step 5 and keep tackling new features and tasks.
10. **Spread the map love**! Then write a blog post about how we made the map and what we learned from it. Write about how other people can make similar maps by forking this one and adding their own data layers.

## Tips for:
### Before the event for organizers:
- Prep with GitHub issues.
- Jot down ideas for projects with links to data sources, open-source libraries/tools, good tutorials to follow.
- Deploy to `gh-pages` from the start so people can keep testing it on all sorts of browsers and devices.

### During the event:
- Find something that interests you and you can actually use
- Keep the prize categories in mind :P
- Wireframe and brainstorm on butcher paper.
- Sketch out flows with Post-Its or whiteboards.
- Keep it simple: Try to focus on one single user’s use case. For now.

### Working on the project
- Pair people up as much as possible. 
- Why? Pairing is important at a hackathon because it keeps people talking to each other, and you can get a gauge of where they are at.
- Pairing also makes it easier to find each other’s typos.
- Ask people “Let’s try..” “Want to try this?”
- Take lots of breaks :-)

# Maptime Meetup guide
1. Draft Meetup information on Google Drive + Slack
- Give people instructions on what to do before they get there. Usually installation (Linux/Mac/Windows) for people who bring laptops. No laptops is okay too.
- Write a story: Why should we attend the meetup? To learn what? Write for beginners. Write also for regular attendees.
- Set learning goals so people know what to expect.
2. Order food and drinks. Prep logistics for that - plates, napkins.
3. Prepare Meetup lesson materials. Post those all online in a GitHub repository so people can clone it before they get there.
4. Take notes and photos during the event. Upload them to Flickr and GitHub.
